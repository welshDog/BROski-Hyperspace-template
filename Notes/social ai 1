### Social AI communication helper for dyslexia-first flow

Love this. Let’s build you an ultra assistant that reads, drafts, summarizes, and acts across email and socials—fast, friendly, and dyslexia-first.

  - **Triage:** Summaries + priority labels + suggested replies.
  - **Compose:** Voice-to-draft + tone shift + auto-proof.
  - **Do:** One-click actions (send, schedule, post, DM, follow-up).
- **Guardrails:** Privacy-safe storage, clear undo, transparent logs.

## System architecture and stack choices

| Layer | Option A: No-code fast build | Option B: Code + APIs | When to pick |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ingestion | Native connectors for Gmail/Outlook, X, LinkedIn, IG, FB, Discord | Provider APIs + webhooks (Node/Python) | A for speed, B for control |
| Brain | Hosted LLM with function calling, safety filters | Self-hosted orchestration (LangChain/LlamaIndex style) | A if timelines are tight |
| Actions | Prebuilt actions for send/post/schedule | Custom action handlers with queues | B for custom rules at scale |
| UI | Web app with UI toolkit (React/Vite/Next) | Same, but fully bespoke components | A for MVP this week |
| Storage | Secure hosted DB/tables + secrets vault | Postgres/SQLite + Redis + secret manager | B if you need complex data |

> Direct answer: We can ship MVP in a week with Option A, then harden with Option B in week 2–3.

## Starter assets you can plug in today

#### Priority labels and definitions
- **Today:** Needs reply or action within 24 hours.
- **This week:** Important but not urgent.
- **Waiting:** You replied; waiting on them.
- **FYI:** No action; archive soon.
- **Hold:** Needs info before action.

#### Reply templates (short, editable)

- **Warm professional**
  ```
  Thanks for reaching out—really appreciate the detail. 
  Quick gist I’m tracking: {{gist}}.
  Here’s what I propose: {{proposal}}.
  If that works, I can: {{next_step}}. 
  Best, Lyndon
  ```

- **Direct decision**
  ```
  Quick decision: {{decision}}.
  Reason: {{reason}}.
  Next step: {{next_step}} by {{date}}.
  ```

- **Gentle bump**
  ```
  Friendly nudge on the note below. 
  Still keen to move this forward. 
  Is {{option_a}} or {{option_b}} better for you?
  ```

- **Social comment (value-add)**
  ```
  Love this angle. Two adds:
  1) {{insight_1}}
  2) {{insight_2}}
  Curious how you see this applying to {{context}}.
  ```

#### Voice-to-draft prompt pattern
```
You are my dyslexia-first comms co-pilot.
Input: bullet notes or voice transcript.
Output: 3 subject lines, a 120–180 word email in Warm tone, and 1-sentence TL;DR.
Respect these constraints: short paragraphs, line spacing, no jargon, clear ask with date.
```

#### Safety and clarity checks
- **Confusion scanner:** Flag long sentences > 24 words; propose splits.
- **Ambiguity:** Highlight vague asks; suggest 1 clear question.
- **Tone risk:** Alert on sarcasm/risk; propose calmer rewrite.

### What I need from you to wire it up

- **Accounts:** Which email (Gmail/Outlook) and which socials (X, LinkedIn, IG, FB, Discord) for v1?
- **Voice:** 3 sample emails and 3 social posts you love; 3 you don’t.
- **Follow-up rules:** Default wait time (3, 5, or 7 days) and time window for batching.
- **Brand phrases:** Words you always use/avoid. Any signatures or links to include.

If you want, I’ll package this as a repo template (README, workflows, JSON config for rules, and UI mock) so you can deploy and iterate fast.
