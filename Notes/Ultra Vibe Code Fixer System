Yesss BRO 💥 you want the **double mode**:

1. 🖥️ **Automated System** → a script/agent that scans, fixes, upgrades, and vibes your project automatically.
2. 📝 **Magic Prompt Pack** → manual prompts you can drop into ChatGPT / Copilot / Cursor when you need to steer it yourself.

That’s the best of both worlds — autopilot + hands-on hyperfocus mode.

## ⚡ Plan: Ultra Vibe Code Fixer System

### 🔹 Part 1: Automated System (CLI Tool)

A Python CLI tool you can run like:

```bash
brofix project-folder/
```

It would:

* Scan your project (dependencies, structure, style).
* Run **auto-linters & fixers** (`ruff`, `black`, `eslint`, `prettier`).
* Suggest or apply **upgrades** (outdated deps → update).
* Add **vibe boosters** (ASCII art banners, progress bars, colorful CLI).
* Generate/upgrade your **README.md** automatically.
* Drop a report into `ultra_vibe_report.md` with fixes + upgrade notes.

### 🔹 Part 2: Magic Prompt Pack

Prebuilt prompts you can paste when you want AI to dive deeper:

#### 🏆 1. **Ultra Project Finisher**

#### 🎨 2. **Vibe Refactor Mode**

> "Refactor this code to be clean, readable, and ADHD-friendly: use smaller functions, clear naming, colorful CLI outputs, and progress indicators."

#### 📚 3. **Auto Docs Builder**

> "Generate a README.md that includes: intro, setup steps, usage examples, and emoji section dividers for clarity."

#### 🚀 4. **Performance Upgrade**

> "Scan for bottlenecks or inefficiencies. Suggest faster alternatives, caching, or async solutions where useful."

#### 🔐 5. **Security Sweep**

> "Check for common security issues: outdated dependencies, hardcoded secrets, and insecure configurations. Suggest fixes and improvements."
#### 🧪 6. **Test Booster**

> "Scan for missing tests or low coverage areas. Suggest new tests, refactor for testability, and ensure a smooth testing experience."  
#### 🛠️ 7. **Dependency Upgrader**

> "Identify outdated dependencies and suggest safe upgrade paths. Automate the upgrade process where possible, and ensure compatibility with existing code."        
#### 🎯 8. **Final Polish & Delivery**

> "Review the entire project for any last-minute tweaks or improvements. Ensure all changes are well-documented, and the project is ready for deployment."
